	<h1>Shopping Calculator</h1>
	<p>I plan on using this in P4. It was more complicated than I originally thought it would be with error checking and calculating taxes.</p>


	<!--Create the main form-->
	<!--Give the form a class and break down the items into products-->

	<form class = "shoppingBag" id="shoppingBagItems">
		<div class = "products">
		<h2>Outerwear</h2>
			<br>
		 	<h3>Hats</h3>
				<p>Keep them warm in style</p>

			<div class = "itemPrice">
				<span>Each hand made hat is only $20</span>
			</div>
			
			<!--I found I creating labels and id's made it easier with Javascript -->

			<div class = "orderQuantity">
				<label for = "orderHats">Order Quantity:</label>
				<input type = "text" id="orderHats" size = "2" placeholder = "0">
			</div>


			<!--Copy and paste then modify values-->

		 	<h3>Coats</h3>
				<p>Kids will loose them so get two!</p>

			<div class = "itemPrice">
				<span>Each coat is only $50</span>
			</div>

			<div class = "orderQuantity">
				<label for = "orderCoats">Order Quantity:</label>
				<input type = "text" id="orderCoats" size = "2" placeholder = "0">
